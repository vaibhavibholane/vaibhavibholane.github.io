        <title>7 Ways that MBA Grads Help Tech Startups</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many sceptics question the value that an MBA grad brings to the table of an early stage tech startup. I personally know some MBAs who did not graduate in computer science and now sadly hesitate to be a part of a tech startup and consider it as a hostile territory. This concern is further aggravated as we see so many successful tech startups founded by engineers. So is MBA really losing value at a technology world?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t think so. Obviously engineers are important to build the startup ship but MBAs are essential to sail it in the right direction. Many early stage startups might bear the misconception that ‘A good working product, satisfying all the customer use cases’ is enough for their growth. But does it hold true for every single startup? So here are some of the many reasons why a tech startup needs an MBA and why one should not hesitate but consider it as an important hop in their career ladder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-the-product&quot;&gt;Managing the product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers are good at solving the problems, they try their best to solve it and most of the times they succeed. They are taught to look at the problems objectively, but when it comes to user experience they are not as good. Here MBA’s hypothesis driven development method comes into picture. In which they look at the requirements of the customer, solution that the product provides, customer behavior and then take the decision. This would definitely avoid building a product that nobody wants.
MBAs are skilled in monitoring the metrics (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate&quot;&gt;CTR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abandonment_rate&quot;&gt;Abandonment Rate&lt;/a&gt;, Conversion Rate that helps to understand the customer’s behavior across the product usage funnel. Their consistent market research help startup to keep their product relevant to the dynamic market conditions and the changing customer requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;companys-growth-and-expansion&quot;&gt;Company’s growth and expansion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to manage people and their tasks when head count is low; but as it scales up, things tend to go a little out of hand. This is when the manager saves the day with his expertise in organisational management where he induces hierarchies, task management tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban&quot;&gt;Kanban&lt;/a&gt;, software development methodologies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&quot;&gt;Agile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development&quot;&gt;Lean&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_model&quot;&gt;Spiral&lt;/a&gt; and helps startups to build sound policies and procedures that will suit their innovative and creative culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;marketing-of-the-product&quot;&gt;Marketing of the product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advancement of technology, various ways of product marketing has emerged. MBAs, being an expert in analyzing competitors’ strategy, customer behavior, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation&quot;&gt;segmentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_market&quot;&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; and market research, identify the right mix of marketing channels to maximise their reach. They help startups with product pricing and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)&quot;&gt;positioning&lt;/a&gt; the product on its value map correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;selling-the-product&quot;&gt;Selling the product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling a technical product = selling any other +  X-factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why so? Because software products can be tailored and thus the person selling these products should have the competency to understand client’s requirements and see how the product fits to fulfill their requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;handling-customer-service&quot;&gt;Handling Customer Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s competitive market, it is difficult to acquire new customer but it even more harder to retain one for long term. Making customers unhappy will not only reduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_lifetime_value&quot;&gt;Customer Lifetime Value&lt;/a&gt; (CLV) but also push them away to the competitors. This makes after sales support, the most important thing for all the firms. Thus, to keep customer happy and satisfied, all the queries, complaints, feedbacks, and suggestions should be handled promptly and properly. MBA’s are taught to be customer obsessed, they prioritize it, give structure to the processes that handles it, and ensures smooth functioning of the complete system and hence they are the better choice to handle this position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-finances&quot;&gt;Managing Finances&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Startups are usually short in cash and thus want to use this limited resource very carefully. Generating profit is important for their growth, but while doing so, they may fall in trap where they might end up spending on something which does not add to profit. Here MBAs, being experts in financial planning, show the profit and cost centers to the owner and help them to maximise gains and minimise costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;managing-human-resources&quot;&gt;Managing Human Resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To manage people, company needs someone who can identify employee’s needs, motivates them and helps them grow with the company. Studies have shown that majority of the founders of startups are generally introvert, hence they may find it difficult to manage the human task force. Again our hero, an MBA guy, comes to the rescue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;summing-it-up&quot;&gt;Summing it up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to grow in all aspects, startups need people who can handle their finances, do product promotion, understand customer needs,  retain them, network with industry experts, manage people and keep them motivated. MBAs are the ones with expertise in all these areas and thus they turn out to be very important asset for any tech startup.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How and Why Businesses Use Social Media</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A new way of networking and marketing emerged with the advent of social media. Today, not just individuals but every company/business/startups/NGO irrespective of their size have social media presence on platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtube.com&quot;&gt;Youtube&lt;/a&gt; etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-businesses-use-social-media&quot;&gt;How businesses use social media?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Promote their product/brand&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn about their customer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Address customer complaints&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Network with current or potential customers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use it as an internal portal where employee share fun moments of office with their colleagues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-businesses-use-it&quot;&gt;Why businesses use it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;access-to-social-media&quot;&gt;Access to social media&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per statistic, on an average a social media user spends about 50 min daily on Facebook, and spends more than 1.30 hr if other social media platforms are also taken into account. And with the smartphone and internet boom, this access to social media has become even more easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-data&quot;&gt;User data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media platforms take the basic profile data such as name, email, birthday, location, job from the user. Users share everything they have in mind, their likes, dislike, favorite food, movie, actors, brands. Social media has the list of your friends, they know what websites you are browsing and for which product, what pages you like, what groups you engage in.
All the businesses want their advertisements to reach their target customers and not wasting their advertisement budget on non target markets. Social media leverages all the data they have to provide businesses the perfect tool to reach their target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;user-attention&quot;&gt;User attention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyday Unknowingly we are exposed to hundreds of advertisements through various media, but only a few of them are able to grab our attention. To win this race for user attention, advertiser has to use the best medium to reach out to us. It is said that we pay full attention while using social media which businesses can leverage to create &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_awareness&quot;&gt;brand awareness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;low-cost-advertising&quot;&gt;Low cost advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As compared to traditional advertising media such as Tv commercial, print media, big hoardings, social media advertisement is cheap and effective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;word-of-mouth&quot;&gt;Word of Mouth&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth&quot;&gt;Word of mouth&lt;/a&gt; is a free tool by which businesses can acquire new customers and social media is the best platform for this. Whenever an user shares or likes any post about the company, it in turn reaches out to his/her friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;creating-user-engagement&quot;&gt;Creating user engagement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses try to engage customers with the brand by conducting competitions, informing them about new offers, discounts, new products/services/features.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>You and Your Social Data</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Social Media has become one of the integral part of our lives. Whenever you find some time spare, you quickly check your social media space created by Internet giants like &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, etc. Why do you do it? According to some psychologists, top reason people turn to social media is to get &lt;strong&gt;social acceptance&lt;/strong&gt; disguised under the name of &lt;strong&gt;entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;. Off late, accessing it has become more easier with the penetration of smartphones and Internet. As per data, in 2011 Facebook had &lt;strong&gt;109 million users in India&lt;/strong&gt;, this number now has proliferated to &lt;strong&gt;226 million&lt;/strong&gt; in 2017, i.e. showing a growth of around &lt;em&gt;108%&lt;/em&gt;. Smartphones ensures this number to grow at 10-15% YOY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the numbers mentioned above, you can imagine the amount and frequency of data being generated and shared everyday, and how important this data can get. We have become so habitual to social networks that with impulse we posts whatever comes to our mind, we share our current locations, the places we visit, the people we are accompanied with, what movie we watch, what restaurants we visit, what cuisine we like and what not. Some clickbait companies have mastered the way to extract this information from Internet giants (with your consent) and build their empires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-kind-of-data-is-collected&quot;&gt;What kind of data is collected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you sign up on to a social platform you generally never hesitate to provide basic information like name, email id, date of birth; Unknowingly you are giving away some very important information, using which Internet giants are piling up tonnes of money. Below I list some information that you are providing to social platforms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;obviously-the-things-you-share&quot;&gt;Obviously the things you share&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you are using a platform, the tings you do are obviously store in their database and they have all right to access, process and analyze it to their advantage. Some examples could be your posts, photos, tagged location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;behind-the-scenes&quot;&gt;Behind the scenes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms also tend to collect data that they can use to understand how you are using their services; so that they could do so called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing&quot;&gt;A/B Testing&lt;/a&gt;. Some examples here are the kind of data you view, hover upon, react and that engages you and the amount of time you spend on any/every section of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;your-friend-circle&quot;&gt;Your friend circle&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the social platforms are “friend” oriented. Hence you tend to tag your friends in some of your post/image/event. This information seems meaningless from the top but deep inside this is used to create a huge gigantic graph/network that shows and represents the interaction depth of two people, relationship, strength of the bond and their &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation&quot;&gt;degree of seperation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;financial-data&quot;&gt;Financial Data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some platforms also provide some kind of services which they charge for and ask you pay via Credit or Debit card, address and contact details. They save this information in their system so that you do not have to type information again and with this they say that they provide you better &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience&quot;&gt;User Experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;device-information&quot;&gt;Device information&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As user can use any device to access any social media, the giants keep track of information like which device you last access their site from or browser you used and even location. This is done so that they could analyze, optimize and target a particular segment and find improvement hot spots in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-they-use-this-data&quot;&gt;How do they use this data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the real question, how are they actually utilizing all of the above information. In this rat race of social media everyone is trying to be the best. There are several uses of the data they collect from you&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;personalization-and-relevance&quot;&gt;Personalization and Relevance&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent past the most booming field and most hyped terminologies were &lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Personalization&lt;/strong&gt;; everybody was (is and are) doing it. Every company (small or huge) wants to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization&quot;&gt;personalize&lt;/a&gt; user experience and show them &lt;a href=&quot;https://relevantor.wordpress.com/2012/02/02/what-is-relevant-content-anyway/&quot;&gt;relevant content&lt;/a&gt;. Right from &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.google.com&quot;&gt;Google News&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.com&quot;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; feeds to &lt;a href=&quot;https://quora.com&quot;&gt;Quora&lt;/a&gt; answers, everything is tailor made - just for you. In order to implement personalization algorithms and make system smarter they need data; and hence they are collecting as much data as they can from the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;revenue-through-advertisements&quot;&gt;Revenue through Advertisements&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Internet companies have “Advertisements” as their revenue stream. More relevant the ads are to the user, higher is the probability of user clicking on the ad and higher is the revenue. Hence system needs to be really smart about what sort of ads to be shows to a user. For this generally your past &lt;strong&gt;browsing history&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;activities&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;interactions&lt;/strong&gt; are taken into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;share-your-data-with-other-applications-and-services&quot;&gt;Share your data with other applications and services&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet giants do not directly sell or share your data to other applications and services. But they do so by taking your consent before sharing it. This is done via &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth&quot;&gt;OAuth (Login via Google/Facebook)&lt;/a&gt;. Social media companies share your public profile data to such third party websites/apps when you login to it using say Facebook/twitter or try to share some website data on Facebook. All such websites are of course obliged to get the permission of user to collect his/her photos, friends list, birthday, timeline posts, but it is always doubtful of how much is any user aware of such things before giving the permission to access his information. Social media companies have no control on how these third parties make use of such shared public data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;data-analytics&quot;&gt;Data Analytics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, credit card companies, retail shops, marketing companies, e-commerce firms use data analytics to their benefit. For e.g. Some credit card companies use your profile, posts, your friends profiles to decide whether to offer you a credit card or not. So in turn, it helps prevent frauds. Some other users of data analytics is target segmentation, anomaly detection, fraud detection and relevance and understanding consumer preferences and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-the-data-be-misused&quot;&gt;Can the data be misused?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes! Of course!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very well written article, written by &lt;a href=&quot;http://arpitbhayani.me&quot;&gt;Arpit&lt;/a&gt;, explains &lt;a href=&quot;http://arpitbhayani.me/blog/beware-of-which-indian-celebrity-do-you-look-like.html&quot;&gt;how facebook apps like “Which Indian Celebrity Do You Look Like” can misuse your data&lt;/a&gt;. I would explain it in a gist here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth&quot;&gt;OAuth authentication&lt;/a&gt; (Login via Facebook) and takes your consent to extract and access some of your data through existing social media. Some of the data requested has nothing to do with the app but still it asks you for it. And Internet giant, since they have your consent, share it with them. Such application/websites may:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sell this data to some fraudulent entity which engages in sending spams or scams.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create fake profiles on different platforms and use it for illegal activities.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Misuse your photos and data to blackmail someone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s world, using social media may be unavoidable, but one can be careful on what data they share publicly. With the impulse, one should not post any incriminating or illegal content, without understanding its ramifications. One should be careful before making any of personal data public. Social media data has been making life easier for users and businesses but this too has a flip side which can be avoided with more shrewd use.
